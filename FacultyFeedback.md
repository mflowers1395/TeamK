# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

## Week 2 - Jan 18 ##

## Week 3 - Jan 25 ##

## Week 4 - Feb 1 ##

- You need two problem statements

## Week 5 - Feb 8 ##
 - Only one story on the board. Don’t have "create more stories" story (create work item template")
 - When faculty visits (facilitator assigned for the week opens the Kanban board and filters on each person). Each team member takes one minute to talk about the work
item they finished, and what work item they are working on. Their should be very little "we" and mostly "I" in explaining completed stories

## Week 6 - Feb 15 ##
- Question about "raw" code: yes you have to write code not use Word Press or Out(something)
- Check on the "Insights" and see who is doing most of the work. It is one of the grading criteria
- Only paired stories. You are mobbing too much and it slows you down. Each person should have a story that they own and are working on each week.

## Week 7 - Feb 22 ##
- Each work item / user story should have detailed description and acceptance criteria/checklist so you know what "done" looks like
- Story #24 has no acceptance

## Week 8 - Mar 1 ##
